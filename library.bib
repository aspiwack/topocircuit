abstract = {This articles plays with several properties of Bishop sets which would be equivalent in ZFC to being finite. One of which is new. This is an occasion to analyse finely the different properties of finite sets and how they (constructively) relate to one another. We close this article by presenting a few well-known algorithms on finite structures, and describe which kind of finiteness they require.},
